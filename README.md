# Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fighting Forest Fires
Forest Fires are an important cause of natural and economical damages that cost over 1 Billion dollars per year for fire retardant. Through addressing this problem we can save lives of firefighters and other humans and save natural resources and animal lives.
## Main parts
main parts of our project are: 1) the environment, 2) the agent, 3) the learning method.
### Environment
The environment we created has the following features:
  1.Grid with any size 
  2. Grid color shows its type:
      * Forest: Green Area
      * Areas without Tree: Brown Area
      * Burnt forest: Black Area
      * Drone Agents: Purple Squares
      * Fire: Red Squares
      * Houses: Blue Square
      * Station of Drones: Yellow Square
  3.The fire propagates according to the direction of the wind using probability of transition
